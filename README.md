Ember app is being developed with following 

    1 - Minimum of 3 break points for mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports.
    2 - Create individual components for the header navigation, hero header, Redefining the web, Services, Our Team, Logos, Contact, and footer.
    3 - The header in the mobile view is fixed to the top of the browser.
    4 - Displayed the navigation in the mobile view.
    5 - Used Bootstrap 3.
    6 - Included at least 2 different context specific modals. 
    7 - I Followed current Ember architecture conventions.

Ember App 

    1 - Index is the root page.
    2 - Added components for each section.
    3 - Created individual components for each sections items. So that code can be reused. E.g. in team section, created separate components like "team-member" to reuse the code.
    4 - Navigation bar is completely Ember based. 
    5 - Form validation is added in contact us form.


Design

    1 - Implemented CTA for all user activity sections, like contact us form.
    2 - As getting the font from design screenshot is little hard to tried to make it as close as possible.

I am sure improvement is possible, so please give me a chance to show all awesomeness of Ember :)
